# HRnet

Welcome to HRnet! This is our company's internal application to create and view employee records.

This is a React update of our main app, built on top of our custom React modal, tailwindcss and the Nextui library.

To run the app, simply install the dependencies usin `npm i`, then run `npm run dev` (or `npm run build` and `npm run preview` for optimized build).
